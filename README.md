## ­Background

Sketching with AI is an interactive sketch tool where users can start drawing on the canvas and AI will finish the sketch. The goal of the project is to provide a powerful and user-friendly drawing web application where users can draw freely. In addition to that, there will be an AI that draws based on the user’s sketch, making the tool more educational and fun to use.
